# Webpack Solidity Loaders
This repository will be a testing ground for
loaders which will be broken out into separate
repositories.

## How to use
#### Dependencies
- `webpack-dev-server`: so if you don't have the
dev server already then run `npm i -g webpack-dev-server`. 
- `ethereumjs-testrpc`, so if you don't have that, then run
`npm install -g ethereumjs-testrpc` and then in a seperate terminal,
start it up with `testrpc`.

#### Usage
```
git clone git@github.com:karlfloersch/webpack-web3-testing.git; 
cd webpack-web3-testing;
npm i;
webpack-dev-server;
```

MIT!
